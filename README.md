# TowerDefense
A family of Tower Defense games
In project, I successfully adopted product family engineering into game development. In order to reuse the components as much as possible, I implemented a generator that could produce a family of tower defense games. Those games look like totally different but share a similar mechanism. In technical aspects, I invented a background controller that could make the game to fit various screen sizes automatically. Also, I developed a plugin for Unity Engine and made it possible for designers to design games by interacting with graphic instead of coding. Apart from these, I use XML to control the spawn of enemies. The game was shown in this February on Digital Media Conference and won a lot of praises.
